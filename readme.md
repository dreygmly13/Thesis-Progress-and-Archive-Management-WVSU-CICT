Abstract

The majority of research papers written by CICT graduates and students are piling up each year, and maintaining and protecting copies of these papers is becoming increasingly difficult. Furthermore, it can be challenging for thesis advisers to keep track of their students' progress on their theses when there is insufficient contact between themselves and the students they are advising. The purpose of this thesis is to design and build a web-based thesis progress monitoring and archiving management system for use by the WVSU CICT.



The College of Information and Communications Technology seeks to develop globally competent ICT professionals, sufficiently equip with appropriate knowledge, skills and attitude, for them to effectively design, develop, implement and manage information and communications technology resources in multi-disciplinary fields.

Specifically, the college endeavors to:


Produce globally and quality graduates who have acquired knowledge and technical skills, have developed personal and social values adaptive to the work environment;

Inculcate in its students value of independent and life-long learning;

Provide valuable services to and share expertise and facilities and various stakeholders on the transfer and promotion of information and communication technology for local, regional and national benefit;

Harness and undertake relevant ICT research directed towards mission-critical, public-service-sensitive, development- management-supportive, and review-generating areas
